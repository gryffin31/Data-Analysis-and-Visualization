In this project, we are going to do some analysis over Co2 emission by different countries across the world.
I hope that this analysis and visualization is going to help young entrepreneurs to take down the global Co2 emission rate.
So, letâ€™s start some data analysis with a cup of coffee.

I have used Jupyter Notebook for coding and imported Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib and Plotly here for our data analysis and visualization here.
You can download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/meetshukla28/global-co2-emissions)
